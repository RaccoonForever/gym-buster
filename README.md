# gym-buster (OPENAI ENV)

The goal is to simulate a ghost buster game with a gym environment. That can be use to do some RL.

## V0.0.2
New version using gym.rendering for graphics. Lighter and faster than Pygame.
Adding position for ghost and ennemies in observation space.
Some refactoring. Code lighter and cleaner.
Some documentation.

## V0.0.1
This first version was using Pygame to implement graphic effects.
Trouble on my own computer to run more than 3 episodes: wrong allocation memory
The game was working well for one episode but it was not enough for RL.
Code architecture was not optimized and too complicated for what I wanted.
